# Portfolio project

**Mixed Messages**

In this project, you’ll build a message generator program that outputs a new, random message every time a user runs the program. Your program should
showcase basic JavaScript syntax and programming concepts.

## General info

### **How Do Portfolio Projects Work?**

We’ll provide you with high-level tasks to guide your project to completion, but you will be responsible for deciding how to implement them in your
code.

There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other
resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Note that there are hints that can assist you, but they will only provide one potential implementation. Do not worry if your program looks different
from ours!

### **Overveiw**

For this project, you will build a message generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. You’re
welcome to take the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make your
program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. Take what you know of JavaScript
syntax so far to build the program and customize it to your liking.

**Project Objectives:**

- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer

### Prerequisites

- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- Command line

## Setup

Going off platform: You will be doing this project outside of the Codecademy platform, on your own computer.

For this particular project, you will be using your own text editor (we suggest VSCode) and
[Git version control](https://www.codecademy.com/content-items/74bb71f3f3d5998245e9bbef934502d9). If you need a refresher on how to work with Git for
version control,
[review the Git lesson](https://www.codecademy.com/paths/full-stack-engineer-career-path/tracks/fscp-git-and-github-part-i/modules/fecp-introduction-to-git/lessons/git-workflow/exercises/git-generalizations)
or look at this [cheat sheet](https://education.github.com/git-cheat-sheet-education.pdf). You’ll also want to have
[Node set up locally](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/setting-up-node-locally) to be able to run your script.

### Debugging Tips

Feeling stuck? Try the following:

- Google your question: oftentimes, someone has had the same question as you! Check out websites like StackOverflow and Dev.to to see how other folks
  have found solutions.
- Read the documentation: make sure to carefully read through the documentation for any languages and libraries that you are using. Oftentimes they’ll
  have examples of what you’re looking for!
- Rubber ducking: try to explain a problem to a friend or co-worker. Oftentimes you’ll figure out the solution as you’re trying to explain it. And if
  not, getting another pair of eyes on your code can be helpful.

vision.
