## Review

Congratulations! The goal of this unit was to introduce you to the Git versioning technology. Understanding Git is a crucial tool in your developer
toolkit—but don’t worry if it didn’t stick! Practice is crucial with Git, which is why we introduced it early in the Path. You also now know how to
take the repositories on your computer and put them online with GitHub. Having your work on Github will be important when you apply for jobs, and now
you also know how to write a solid README.md with markdown.

After this unit, you will be able to:

Version control projects using Git Host a codebase online using GitHub repositories Use markdown to author a good README.md file Remember, you will
put all of this knowledge into practice with an upcoming Portfolio Project. If you ever get stuck while working on the project, you can come back to
this Unit and review what you have learned.
